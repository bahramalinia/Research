{\color{blue}The reviewers have identified several issues with the paper that lie mainly with a lack of justification for some of the assumptions made which restrict the value of the theoretical results produced. Also the authors need to clearly delineate this work from their previous work. A major revision of this paper is recommended.}

\section{Reviewer $\# 1$}

{\color{blue} The authors fail to explain the difference of the first part on the fractional model from their earlier work: several 2-competitive scheduling methods are listed by Alinia et al. (2018) and references, including an algorithm with a better competitive ratio and/or runtime. I think this should not have been included in this paper. }
\vspace{3mm}

$\vartriangleright$ \noindent\textbf{Response:} 
Our earlier work presents algorithms for only fractional revenue model. Current manuscript, which can be considered as journal extension of the previous work, studies both fractional and integral models. Although the presented algorithms in the conference version provide a competitive ratio of $2-1/U$ (with $U$ as "scarcity level"), the proof holds when all EVs have the same maximum charging rate. In the current study, we consider hetregenousity in this parameter and prove the online algorithm is 2-competitive.

To clarify this, we added an explanation in Section ...   

\vspace{3mm}
{\color{blue} Furthermore, why is there no inclusion of electricity prices and/or value for demand response, which is a particular powerful use case for EV charging scheduling? More generally speaking, please add a proper motivation of the two models: when would we use which model in practice? }
\vspace{3mm}

{\color{red}: @Mohammad: This is not clear for me in most parts} 

$\vartriangleright$ \noindent\textbf{Response:} 
The variable $v_i$ defined in the paper is valuation of EV $i$ when it receives its demand $D_i$. In simple and default case $v_i$ can represent the price imposed by charging station that the owner of EV $i$ should pay to receive its demand, $D_i$ (as it is in the paper). In this case, the charging station is allowed to use any pricing policy as it does not affect our algorithms. With this interpretation, our algorithms solve revenue maximization problem for utility provider. $v_i$ can also represent the valuation of demand from the user's point of view indicating that how much the user will be happy if it receives its submitted demand. With this interpretation, our algorithms try to maximize users' satisfaction or users' social welfare. Therefore, our proposed algorithms are general and work for any valuation setting that is proposed by either EVs or charging stations.
	
\vspace{3mm}
{\color{blue} The approach for the integral model seems novel to me, and it is nice that a theoretical analysis is included. However, the theoretical results are disappointing, which reduces their value a bit: they only hold under severe restrictions: Thm.4 only holds "when EVs have same arrival time" ... which is quite unrealistic. Thm.5 only holds for m=1, which is the single constraint often found in literature. (Of which the authors write: [our] "problem is different from EV charging scheduling with capacity constraint in single station scenarios [2], [4], [7]â€“[12]".). Moreover, the ratios are pretty weak (for Thm.4: number of charging stations +1 times the optimal, for Thm.5: number of different arrival slots + 1 times the optimal). }

\vspace{3mm}
{\color{blue} Actual useful proof of the quality of the proposed algorithm can be found in the experiments. I think the paper could be interesting if this section received significantly more attention, for example
 - showing the effect of problem parameters (range in arrival times, departure times, values, demand, number of vehicles, etc.) on the performance of the  algorithms (not only value but also computation time)
 - comparing to other methods from the literature, e.g. Yao et al. (2017) use a charging priority (think of this as your value) and adding the extra CS constraints is pretty straightforward for such MILP models. Moreover, Yao et al. (2017) also include prices as well as demand response, but also these can of course just be ignored.
 }
\vspace{3mm}

$\vartriangleright$ \noindent\textbf{Response:} 
{\color{red}@Mohammad: We should try to distinguish our work from Yao et al. but it seems difficult.}

\vspace{3mm}
{\color{blue} The implementation of the algorithms and the benchmark problems would be helpful if submitted as supplementary files. }
\vspace{3mm}

$\vartriangleright$ \noindent\textbf{Response:} 
We listed pseudo-codes for all proposed algorithms and an interested reader can easily convert them to real implementation code. We believe that detailed implementation of the algorithms has no added value as the goal here is to provide algorithms and analysis and not focusing on programming challenges.
  
\vspace{3mm}
{\color{blue} On page 2 and page 7 you write that "the underlying problem is NP-hard due to 0/1 selection" and you mention knapsack, but in fact knapsack is one of the easier NP-hard problems. It seems that your integral model models a strongly NP-hard problem, see De Weerdt et al. (2018). }
\vspace{3mm}

$\vartriangleright$ \noindent\textbf{Response:} 
Thanks for the point. We agree that our problem is strongly NP-Hard and we corrected the related phrases in the manuscript.

\vspace{3mm}
{\color{blue} On page 4, l19, the constraint (1d) seems to force equal charging speed from the arrival time to the departure time. I don't think this constraint is met by the greedy algorithms, is it? Then this is not your "Scheduling Problem for Adaptive charging Network (SPAN) under fractional revenue model"? }

\vspace{3mm}
{\color{blue} p4: The discussion of the offline algorithm could benefit from an example why straightforwardly allocating the most valuable ($v_i/D_i$) is not optimal (because of charging speed limits), and then introduce the greedy re-allocation (based on flexibility). }

$\vartriangleright$ \noindent\textbf{Response:} 
...

\vspace{3mm}
{\color{blue} In the experimental evaluation the results for both models are put together in the same figure, which gets us into the odd situation that some results are better than optimal.

{\color{blue} An interesting extension would be to let users define a set of CSs to charge and let the scheduling algorithms take the final decision of the CS to charge. In this way, the flexibility of the algorithms would increase and the load across the CSs could be better managed. However, the downside would be that the complexity of the algorithms would increase. }

{\color{blue} Is truth telling regarding the EVsâ€™ valuations guaranteed? Is it possible for the EVs to cooperate and report lower valuations? It is not clear in the paper. If not, this could come in contrast with the revenue maximization objective function. Moreover, this would cause serious implications in the online algorithms which use the valuations to select the EVs to charge.     }
